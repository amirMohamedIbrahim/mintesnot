<p> The lion possesses both beauty and strength. Lions are nicknamed "the king of the jungle." Adult male lions have thick brown hair named manes. This manes encircle their neck and protect them during fighting. Lions are the only social
  member of cat family. Lions live in a large group called prides. Lions within a pride are often affectionate and, when resting, seem to enjoy good fellowship with each other. However, the males are very territorial and will roar and use scent markings to establish their territory.
  Lions often rest during the day and hunt at nights. The Female, called Lionesses do almost all of the hunting.  They work in teams to stalk and ambush prey.
